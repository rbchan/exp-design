## Course Objectives
To understand: (1) the logical structure of experiments, especially the design of manipulative experiments, (2) the analysis of such experiments, focusing on analysis of variance procedures, (3) the use of models in ecological studies (experimental and observational).

## Approach

The above components of a scientific study need to be considered together rather than separately; design and analysis aspects will be completely blended in this course.  Emphasis will be on application, and will include instruction on the use of the `R` statistical software.  Important points will be reinforced by readings from the scientific literature and by discussions.  Homework assignments and exams (take home) are intended to keep the material fresh in the students' minds.  The syllabus below is subject to change, but the order of material is correct.

## Schedule


| Week | Topic | Lab | Reading |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------- |
1      | Course introduction | Introduction to R | Chapter 1 |
       | t-tests             |                   | Chapter 8 |
       | t-tests             |                   |           |




## Books 

Chapters above are from: 
Dowdy, S., S. Weardon and D. Chilko. 2004. Statistics for Research, 3rd ed.  John Wiley & Sons
     [eBook available for free through the UGA library](http://dx.doi.org.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/10.1002/0471477435)

Lab readings will be assigned from:
Dalgaard, P. 2008. Introductory Statistics with R. 2nd edition. Springer. 
      [eBook available for free through the UGA library](http://preproxy.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-79054-1)

Additional readings will come from a variety of sources, including other textbooks and scientific journals.

## Grades
Three take-home exams, 25% each.  Exam dates above are approximate days when the exam will be provided.  The last exam will largely take the form of a scientific paper - more details later. The remaining 25% of the grade will come from weekly lab assignments.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in the University's [academic honesty policy](https://honesty.uga.edu/).  All students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.  The [penalties for academic dishonesty](https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Consequences_for_Honesty_Violations/) are severe, and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.
