## Course Objectives
To understand: (1) the logical structure of experiments, especially the design of manipulative experiments, (2) the analysis of such experiments, focusing on analysis of variance procedures, (3) the use of models in ecological studies (experimental and observational).

## Approach

The above components of a scientific study need to be considered together rather than separately; design and analysis aspects will be completely blended in this course.  Emphasis will be on application, and will include instruction on the use of the `R` statistical software.  Important points will be reinforced by readings from the scientific literature and by discussions.  Homework assignments and exams (take home) are intended to keep the material fresh in the students' minds.  The syllabus below is subject to change, but the order of material is correct.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in the University's [academic honesty policy](https://honesty.uga.edu/).  All students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.  The [penalties for academic dishonesty](https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Consequences_for_Honesty_Violations/) are severe, and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.
