Course materials for 'Experimental Methods in Forestry and Natural Resources Research' (FANR 6750). 

## Website 

This repository holds the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts and the [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) files that I use to create my lecture and lab slides. You can access course materials here or through the accompanying [**website**](https://rbchan.github.io/exp-design/) built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Overview
The focus of the course is on the design and analysis of data from manipulative experiements, but we also cover some basic models used in the analysis of observational data. Topics include:

* One-way ANOVA, completely randomized model
* Blocking and blocked designs	
* A x B factorial designs
* Nested Designs
* Split plot designs
* Repeated measures ANOVA	
* Generalized linear models

More details can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## History
This is a course that I co-instruct with Bob Cooper at the University of Georgia. Bob desiged the course and has taught it for >15 years. I started in 2013, which is when we added an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) lab. This repository primarily contains the lab materials, but the lecture notes might be added later.
