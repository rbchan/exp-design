## History
This is a course that I co-instruct with Bob Cooper at the University
of Georgia. Bob desiged the course and has taught it for >15 years. I
started in 2013, which is when we added an `R` lab. This repository
primarily contains the lab materials, but the lecture notes might be
added later.
