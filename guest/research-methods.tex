  \frametitle{Example: Timber harvest and salamanders}
  Suppose we wish to assess the effect of timber harvest on salamander
  abundance.  One plot is established in each of two forests, one
  thinned and the other untreated, in which we trap salamanders at $n=9$
  pitfall traps.  %The response variable of interest is the number of a
  %species captured per trap.  The explanatory variable is silvicultural
  %treatment. \\

  \vfill
  The response variable of interest is the number of red-backed
  salamanders captured per trap.  The explanatory variable is harvest
  treatment (thinned/not). We find more salamanders on the untreated
  plot, and conclude that thinning is bad for salamanders.  What is
  wrong with this design?

  {\bf Problems}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unreplicated
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Impossible to account for other sources of variation.
      \item Increasing sample size will yield more precise estimates
        of treatment effects.
        \end{itemize}
    \item[]
    \item<2-> No randomization
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Confounding of sources of variation -- is the difference
          due to treatment or location or some other unmeasured variable? 
        \item Randomization will reduce potential for bias in
          estimates of treatment effects.
      \end{itemize}      
    \item[]
    \item<3-> Pseudoreplication
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Incorrect error degrees of freedom in a statistical test.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  Without randomization, the observed effect could be due to a

  abundance, but ``distance to stream'' is a {\it common cause} of
  both thinning and salamander abundance. \\

  \frametitle{Example 2: Growth and survival of
    tree seedlings in a bottomland forest}
  Suppose we wish to understand the factors that influence growth and
  survival of tree seedlings in a periodically flooded bottomland
  forest.  Depending on our objectives (and prior knowledge), we might
  take several approaches to address this topic. \\
  \vfill
  \includegraphics[height=1.6in]{seedlings-obs} \hfill
  \includegraphics[height=1.6in]{seedlings-exp} 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Example 2: Growth and survival of
    tree seedlings in a bottomland forest}
  Option 1: Manipulative experiment -- focus on a few key variables of
  particular interest and attempt to hold all else constant.
  \vspace{6pt}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For example, manipulate shading and flooding (plus
      interactions) in a greenhouse setting.
    \item Other factors (soil, herbivory, etc.)  held constant.
    \item Features of good experimental design still needed, even in a
      highly controlled laboratory and greenhouse setting.
    \item Cause and effect can be established in the greenhouse, but
      will they extrapolate to a field setting?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Example 2: Growth and survival of
    tree seedlings in a bottomland forest}
  Option 2: Observation study -- measure factors (variables) {\it in
    situ} that you think will influence growth and survival of seedlings. 
  \vspace{6pt}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Control and manipulate nothing
    \item Examine correlations between growth of seedlings and
      the explantory variables
    \item Find the best model from a candidate set based upon
      hypotheses. Models should be predictive and
      mechanistic (based on theory).
    \item Must be wary of confounding variables, especially
      confounders that cannot (or were not) be measured.
    \item Remember that {\it ``correlation does not imply
        causation''}, but in certain cases it does. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Causal inference in observational studies}
  \small
  A huge body of literature now exists on causal inference in
  observational studies. These methods allow researchers to determine
  when correlation implies causation. Details are fairly technical. \\

  \frametitle{Example 3: Effect of effluent from a new power plant on
    fish species richness in a river}
  A new power plant is to be established along the Oconee River.  We
  know for several years beforehand that the plant will be built.  So
  a survey is designed where fish are sampled periodically above
  (upriver from) and below (downriver from) the site, with repeated
  surveys done before and after the plant goes on line.  These are
  then compared to assess the effect of the plant on species richness.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Observational vs experimental research}
  Are manipulative experiments better than observation studies? \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Typically, yes, if good experimental design is used and the
      variables of interest can be manipulated.
    \item However, a poorly designed experiment can be worse a good
      observational study and manipulative experiments aren't always
      possible. 
  \end{itemize}
  % \pause
  % \vfill
  % Consider using a combination of experimental and observational
  % methods.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  What does this mean for graduate student research?
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Graduate students only have a couple of years to create an
      interesting question, design a study to address that question,
      collect and analyze data, and write a thesis.
    \item Long-term study usually out of the question.
    \item Focus on a particular question in a broader framework.
    \item Often, students are handed a thesis topic. Pros and cons.
    \item Well-designed manipulative experiments usually make for
      stronger inference but are not always appropriate or possible. 
    \item Observational studies are fine, but there are many pitfalls
      to be wary of, e.g. confounders.
    \item Consider using a combination of observational and
      experimental methods.
