# Welcome

## Overview

Eventually, this site will hold course materials for FANR 6750, a course on experimental design and analysis for new grad students at UGA. This is the first site I've tried to build with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it's going to be in rough shape for awhile.
