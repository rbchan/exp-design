## Caution

This is the first site I've tried to build a site with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it's going to be in rough shape for awhile. 

## Overview

Eventually, this site will hold course materials for FANR 6750, a course on experimental design and analysis for new grad students at UGA. In addition to covering classical topics on the treatment of data from manipulative experiments, we also cover some basic models used in the analysis of observational data. Topics include:

* One-way ANOVA, completely randomized model
* Blocking and blocked designs	
* A x B factorial designs
* Nested Designs
* Split plot designs
* Repeated measures ANOVA	
* Generalized linear models

More details can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## History
This is a course that I co-instruct with Bob Cooper at the University
of Georgia. Bob desiged the course and has taught it for >15 years. I
started in 2013, which is when we added an `R` lab. This repository
primarily contains the [lab materials](labs/labs.md), but the [lecture notes](lectures/lectures.md) might be
added later.
