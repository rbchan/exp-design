## Overview

This site holds lecture and lab materials for FANR 6750, a course on experimental design and analysis for new graduate students at UGA. In addition to covering topics on study design and the analysis of data from manipulative experiments, we also cover some basic models used in the analysis of observational data. Topics include:

* [One-way ANOVA, completely randomized model](labs/ANOVA/lab-ANOVA.md)
* [Blocking and blocked designs](labs/blocking/blocking.md)
* [A x B factorial designs](labs/factorial/lab-factorial.md)
* Nested Designs
* Split plot designs
* Repeated measures ANOVA
* Generalized linear models

More details can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

A GitHub repository with the source code is [here](https://github.com/rbchan/exp-design).

## History
This is a course that I co-instruct with Bob Cooper at the University of Georgia. Bob designed the course and has taught it for >15 years. I started in 2013, which is when we added an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) lab. This site contains the [lab materials](labs/labs.md), but the [lecture notes](lectures/lectures.md) might be added later. Currently, there isn't much up yet, but I plan on adding a new lab each week during the fall 2018 semester.
